# Low-frequency regime where PINNs excel

# Domain
domain:

# PDE parameters - SIMPLIFIED (low frequency, proven range)
pde:
  k_train_min: 3.141592653589793   # 1*pi (much easier than 8*pi)
  k_train_max: 6.283185307179586   # 2*pi (much easier than 16*pi)
  n_k_train: 4  # Reduced from 8 (fewer k values to learn)

# Source term (Gaussian) - LARGER for easier learning
source:
  center: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]  # Centered (symmetric)
  width: 0.15              # Wider (smoother solution)
